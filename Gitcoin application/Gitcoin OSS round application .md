## **Project Affiliations**

Assembly Press (AP) is the result of a year's worth of research and experimentation by Public Assembly, an on-chain collective committed to "creating what's missing." AP is our comprehensive solution for the blockchain space, providing a full-stack framework for developing on-chain applications, including protocol, backend, frontend, design, and education.

Earlier iterations of the framework lacked documentation and were focused on specific use cases. However, recent overhauls have resulted in a revamped version, ready to serve as the basis for collaboration beyond Public Assembly. You can explore a [demo of the framework](https://assembly-press.vercel.app/) to see all the components working together.
