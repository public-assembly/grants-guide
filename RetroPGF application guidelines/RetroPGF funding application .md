### Describing your Contributions

This first section is all about what you’ve built. It doesn’t matter if you’re building a consumer app, a key piece of infra that Optimism pays for, or a free-to-use community tool that Optimists love. If you’re providing impact, you are eligible!

- Clearly state the problems you've solved and for whom
- Be sure to provide the most important information in the first few sentences.
- Try to be specific and avoid jargon.
- Don’t allude to your future plans or make promises of future work - this could lead to your application being disqualified.

### Contributions links

Where can badgeholders find out more about your contributions? Examples: a website, Github repository, on-chain contract.

Eg. Optimism contract (etherscan url), with a short description

### Selecting your impact category

The categories are structured to describe who benefited from your contribution. The categories are used for badgeholders to understand how your contributions have supported the development and adoption of Optimism.

You can select multiple categories, but try to select the categories that best describe your impact!

- RetroPGF rewards will be allocated based on the assessment of your individual profile. Selecting all categories will not yield an advantage in the evaluation of your project.

These are the categories included:

1. **OP Stack:** Work that increased the efficiency, security, resillience and awareness of the OP Stack
2. **Collective Governance:** Work that provided impact to governance participants of the Optimism collective, or helped bring new governance participants into the collective.
3. **Developer Ecosystem:** Work that provided impact to application developers in the Optimism Collective, or helped bring new developers into the Collective.
4. **End User Experience & Adoption:** Work that provided impact to end users in the Optimism Collective, or helped bring new users into Collective

Describe the impact your contributions had on the Optimism Collective!

### Impact metrics

Highlight metrics to help badgeholders understand your impact. You can link to data dashboards, onchain contracts, spreadsheets, or any resources.

## Step 3 :Grants and funding

Badgeholders must understand how much OP, revenue, or funding they have already received for their contributions. This allows RetroPGF to fairly compensate the impact to the Collective.

**The more accurate this information is, the more likely you will receive the right amount of RetroPGF.** You only need to add information about grants or revenue related to the contributions you’re looking to receive RetroPGF for.

- List funding and grants that directly or indirectly relate to your contribution
    - Did you receive a grant for your contribution?
    - Did users pay for your contribution?
    - Did you receive donations for your contribution?
- If you received a grant from the Token House (Missions, grants council, etc.), you must report this under the “Governance fund” category.
- You do not need to provide VC funding or other investments in your project or person.
- If you’re applying for contributions made over a long period, you should at a minimum report grants and funding received since 01.06.2022.

## Step 4: Payout address

Make sure to enter a valid OP Mainnet address and that you read and follow the terms. below:

- I understand that RetroPGF grant recipients must complete KYC with the Optimism foundation.
